<!---------- START ARTICLE CONTENT ---------->
<p>The PlayStation 3 is one of my all-time favorite game consoles. I
still play it occasionally, and I played on it extensively years ago
when it was the state-of-the-art game console. In this article, I
step through each applicable setting on my PS3 system in order to
list them here and discuss the basis for how each should be set.
Going forward, I intend to capture my game play at the highest
practical quality. As such, I also consider the pertinent
capabilities of my Magewell USB Capture HDMI Plus capture card.
Finally, it is also important that I consider the <a href=
"https://palomba.io/articles/optimizing-the-vizio-d40u-d1-tv-video-and-audio/"
target="_blank">capabilities of the TV</a> that is being used for
display as well.
<h3>Setting Evaluation</h3>
<h4>PS - Upscaler</h4>
<p>The first applicable setting is "<a href=
"https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/gamesettings.html"
target="_blank">PS - Upscaler</a>" in the "Game Settings" list. If
you have a PS3 that supports PS2 games, this setting is labeled as
"PS / PS2 - Upscaler". This setting allows the user to decide whether
PS1 and PS2 games run at their native resolution (Off), run upscaled
with the 4:3 aspect ratio preserved (Normal), or run upscaled and
stretched to simulate a 16:9 aspect ratio (Full Screen). PS1 and PS2
games can be upscaled to 1080p. In general, I do not intend to use
the "Full Screen" setting, since this alters the image via
stretching. As of this writing, I do not know the kind and quality of
the algorithm that the PS3 uses to upscale the video. Moreover,
modern TVs must upscale the standard definition video signal they
receive regardless, and I will probably never know any specifics
regarding the algorithm used by my TV. Therefore, I recommend trying
this set to both off and "Normal" with your TV to see which looks
best to you. For recording and streaming game play, I typically leave
this setting off for two reasons: to ensure that smaller video file
sizes are created and to enable the use of known, high quality
upscaling algorithms in OBS Studio on my computer.

<h4>PS - Smoothing</h4>
<p>The next setting is "<a href=
"https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/gamesettings.html"
target="_blank">PS - Smoothing</a>" in the "Game Settings" list. If
you have a PS3 that supports PS2 games, this setting is labeled as
"PS / PS2 - Smoothing". This is used to alter the displayed image of
PS1 and PS2 games by reducing picture roughness. I recommend starting
with this setting set off and turning it on later after some time to
see which looks best to you. For recording and streaming game play, I
typically leave this setting off for two reasons: to preserve the
original image and to allow the application of known, high quality
filtering effects in OBS Studio on my computer.

<h4>Stereo Headset Audio Extension</h4>
<p>Next is the "Stereo Headset Audio Extension" setting in the
"Accessory Settings" list. Typically, this setting should be set off.
Many years ago, I had a <a href=
"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HVBPRUO" target="_blank">PlayStation
Gold Wireless Headset</a> that was compatible and could receive all
audio via the USB port dongle. I purchased it early in 2014, because
I had wanted to upgrade to a wireless headset compatible with both
the PS3 and PS4. As far as I am aware, this is the only headset that
can receive all audio via the PS3's USB ports. However, after some
years, the rubber ear cushions began to deteriorate and crumble.
Before I had this headset, I had a wired one that would take the
audio signal from the PS3's analog audio output cables.

<h4>Video and Audio Output</h4>
<p>The user should follow the prompts in the "<a href=
"https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/videooutput.html"
target="_blank">Video Output Settings</a>" option in the "Display
Settings" list next. I use the HDMI output since it is the highest
quality option. Modern TVs should be able to support all four of the
PS3's video output resolutions (i.e., 480p, 720p, 1080i, and 1080p).
One can select the "Custom" option to select them all and ensure that
the PS3 can automatically choose the best output resolution for the
game being played.

<figcaption>Fig. 5: Video output settings

</figure>
<p>Subsequently, the prompts allow the user to select the option to
set the <a href=
"https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/audiooutput.html"
target="_blank">audio output settings</a>. Again, the HDMI output is
the highest quality option. HDMI-embedded audio is also the simplest
to use with both my capture card and any modern TV. The "Automatic"
option should allow the PS3 to automatically determine which audio
output formats are compatible with the connected TV or sound system.
Linear PCM is basically the raw, uncompressed audio produced by the
game being played, and should be compatible with all modern TVs. As
such, this is the highest quality you can get. The higher, upsampled
frequencies are not always compatible, however. Although my capture
card can support up to eight audio channels as input, it appears that
only two channel sound, or stereo sound, can be captured from the
HDMI signal. This is sufficient for recording game play, streaming
game play, and playing with my headset. I have also received
information from Magewell support stating that only Linear PCM audio
is supported by the capture card. As such, I only selected the
"Linear PCM 2 Ch. 44.1 kHz" and "Linear PCM 2 Ch. 48 kHz" options.
The PS3 selects the most appropriate of these two formats depending
on the content being played, which is likely always "Linear PCM 2 Ch.
48 kHz" for games. If you have a fancy sound system for your
entertainment setup, some of the other audio output formats might be
useful for you. However, my understanding is that you can't go wrong
with Linear PCM for this use case. All audio output formats supported
by my PS3 for potential use when using the HDMI output are listed as
follows.
<ul>
<li><p>Dolby Digital 5.1 Ch.
<li><p>Dolby Digital Plus
<li><p>Dolby TrueHD
<li><p>DTS 5.1 Ch.
<li><p>DTS-HD High Resolution Audio

<h4>RGB Full Range (HMDI)</h4>
<p>Next is the "<a href=
"https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/rgbfullrange.html"
target="_blank">RGB Full Range (HDMI)</a>" setting in the "Display
Settings" list. This setting is for use when the capture card or TV
is connected to the PS3 system using an HDMI cable. For RGB video
signals, the range of the color scale that is input to the TV must
depend on the TV in use. A limited RGB output signal represents each
color in an intensity gradient of 16 to 235 and is traditionally the
only range supported by TVs. A full RGB output signal is in the range
of 0 to 255 and is the typical range used by computers. This is set
to "Full" on my PS3, since this is supported by my capture card.
Additionally, <a href=
"https://palomba.io/articles/optimizing-the-vizio-d40u-d1-tv-video-and-audio/"
target="_blank">my TV likely supports the full RGB color space</a> as
well.

<h4>Deep Color Output (HDMI)</h4>
<p>Finally, there is the "<a href=
"https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/deepcolor.html"
target="_blank">Deep Color Output (HDMI)</a>" setting in the "Display
Settings" list. Normally, the red, green, and blue colors for each
pixel are each represented by 8 bits (i.e., an intensity gradient of
0 to 255). Deep color settings instead allow color to be represented
by 10 bits, 12 bits, etc. As of this writing, I have not found a
reliable source that specifies exactly what bit depth(es) are
supported by the PS3. This is set to "Automatic". My capture card
supports 8, 10, and 12-bit color, and <a href=
"https://palomba.io/articles/optimizing-the-vizio-d40u-d1-tv-video-and-audio/"
target="_blank">my TV likely supports 10-bit color</a>. I am curious
to see what games support this feature. When playing, I will keep an
eye on my capture card software utility to see when it detects a
higher bit depth and perchance make a list.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This wraps up the pertinent settings available in the PS3. There
are other settings not mentioned here that affect video and audio on
the PS3, but these are stated to only affect video or audio playback.
The settings do not affect game video or audio. Note that since the
PS3 doesn't support USB or Bluetooth headsets for game audio, I use
my capture card, which converts the HDMI-embedded audio into an
analog signal (3.5 mm) that I can input directly into my headset.
